# Generating_Keywords_for_Google_Ads
 
 ## Project Overview

 Imagine working for a digital marketing agency tasked with creating a prototype set of keywords for a massive online retailer of furniture. The client is a low-cost retailer that wants to target price-sensitive customers by running search campaigns for various furniture products, including sofas, convertible sofas, love seats, recliners, and sofa beds.

This project involves generating a list of keywords that align with the client's requirements and combining these keywords with the product names to create meaningful search keywords. The keywords will be categorized by match type (exact match and phrase match), and the resulting data will be organized in a structured format for use in digital marketing campaigns.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are as follows:

1) Generate a list of keywords that align with the client's requirement for low-cost furniture products.
2) Combine keywords with product names to create meaningful search keywords.
3) Organize the keywords into a structured format for use in digital marketing campaigns.
4) Create a CSV file for easy integration with digital advertising platforms.

## Usage

This project is intended for use by digital marketing professionals and data analysts who need to generate keywords for advertising campaigns. It streamlines the process of keyword generation, making it efficient and structured.

## Getting Started

Before you begin using this project, ensure that you have the necessary software and libraries installed. You'll need Python and libraries for data manipulation (e.g., Pandas).

## Instructions

* Generate Words: Start by brainstorming words that align with the client's requirements. These words should include terms related to low-cost furniture, discounts, and promotions.

* Combine Words with Product Names: Combine each word with each product name once before and once after. This step results in a list of search keywords that reflect the client's objectives.

* Convert to DataFrame: Convert the list of lists into a DataFrame to easily manipulate and manage the keywords.

* Rename Columns: Rename the columns of the DataFrame to make them more meaningful. Columns should be labeled as "Ad Group" (e.g., "sofas") and "Keyword" (e.g., "sofas buy").

* Add a Campaign Column: Add a new column named "Campaign" to identify the campaign name. In this case, the campaign name is 'SEM_Sofas.'

* Create Match Type Column: Categorize keywords into match types, starting with "exact match" to ensure precision in targeting price-sensitive customers.

* Duplicate Keywords: Duplicate all the keywords into 'phrase match' to broaden visibility and discover additional high-quality keywords.

* Save and Summarize: Save the generated keywords in a CSV file for easy integration with advertising platforms. Additionally, create a summary of the campaign structure, grouping by ad group and criterion type.

##  Data Structure

The resulting DataFrame will have the following columns:

Ad Group: Represents the product category (e.g., "sofas").
Keyword: Represents the generated search keyword (e.g., "sofas buy").
Campaign: Identifies the campaign name (e.g., 'SEM_Sofas').
Match Type: Categorizes keywords as "exact match" or "phrase match."

## Summary

This keyword generator streamlines the process of creating search keywords for digital marketing campaigns, specifically targeting price-sensitive customers for a low-cost furniture retailer. The generated keywords are categorized by match type and can be easily integrated into advertising platforms.

For a comprehensive understanding of the campaign structure, refer to the data structure outlined in the Data Structure section. Together with additional tables for ads and landing pages, this project forms the foundation of a successful digital marketing campaign for the furniture retailer.
